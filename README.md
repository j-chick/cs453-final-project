[_Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics_](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf)

### Abstract

> Many applications in computer graphics require complex, highly detailed models. However, the level of detail actually necessary may vary considerably. To control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed models. We have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. By contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. This can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. In order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models

## Setup

If you have some way to view ply files that you'd rather use than Vedo, then the only dependecy that must be installed in NumPy. We tested this on Mac OS (Catalina & Big Sur) code with python 3.9.0 and NumPy 1.19.4 through Anaconda.

Assuming you do want Vedo, use the following installation instructions:

### conda

For ideal results, use this:

``` bash
# NOTE It might take a while for conda to figure out the dependency structure...ÃŸ
conda install -c conda-forge vtk=8.1.2 vedo
```

...and if that doesn't work, just do this:

``` bash
consta install -c conda-forge vedo
```

<!-- REVIEW 

``` bash
conda create --file requirements.txt --name viz python=3.9 -y
conda activate viz
``` -->

### pip

``` bash
pip(3) install vedo
```

<!-- REVIEW 

``` bash
# NOTE try pip3 if that doesn't work on Mac OS Catalina or later.
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` -->

## Running the Algorithm

``` bash
$ python src/main.py \
    --input-path models/panther.ply \
    --n-contractions 200 \
    --simple-pair-selection
```
